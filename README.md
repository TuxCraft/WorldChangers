A mine craft WIP mod by TuxCraft and Tommy Stanley (You can change your name if you wish, if not delete this line)

Current mod version: 0.1BETA
Current mine craft version: 1.6 (A stable forge release has not come out yet for 1.6)

DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE WITHOUT WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM TUXCRAFT

Notes:

Just the files that go into the mcl folder. I have a feeling both Mojang, and the Forge/MCP team would not appreciate us redistributing the MCP folder.

@Tommy Look at the volcano code to get the general gist of how it works, feel free to tweak the code and see what happens. Once you feel like your ready try making the crater. A giant hemisphere that spawns in the ground with a max radius of 20 blocks. If you feel like that is too hard or if you have questions please tell me.
